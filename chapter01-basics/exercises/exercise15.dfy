// Comment out the preceding lemma so we can proceed.

// Here's one solution: rewrite modesty with a (finite) set:
function ModestNumbers() : set<int> {
  set x | 0 <= x < 10
}

lemma ThisSetIsObviouslyFinite()

  var modestEvens := set x | x in ModestNumbers() && IsEven(x);

// But wait a second, instructor! You just moved the finite set comprehension
// inside the function!
// Yeah, so what? You got a problem with that?
// You could build the ModestNumbers set any other way you like; all dafny
// needs to use it in the modestEvents comprehension is that its value is a
// finite-set type.
// You could construct ModestEvens using recursion (which we'll do later
// when we introduce Hoare logic)
// or axiomatize it (which we'll introduce later).

// (No, there's nothing to do here other than comment out the broken definition
// and then read and understand the explanation for the corrected one.)
