//#title Final Project
//#desc Design a Sharded Hash Table (SHT) protocol and prove it is correct.

// XXX TODO right now we don't give students ANYTHING about the trusted framework.
// That feels like too little -- we're not trying to teach people to construct new
// trusted frameworks, since the same basic framework can be reused in many settings.

// The SHT should consist of a number of nodes storing key-value pairs.
// There are no external clients; the nodes perform Get()'s and Put()'s on the keys directly.
// A node can only perform a Get or Put on a key it owns.
// Each key is owned by exactly one node.
// A node can transfer ownership of a set of keys (a.k.a. shard) to another node by sending it a TransferMessage that is delivered asynchronously (i.e. as part of a different state transition)
// All actions should be defined at the protocol level (i.e. as predicates) and not as imperative methods.
//
// The entire application should behave like a logically centralized hash table.

// You should assume that the network delivers packets at-most-once so you don't
// have to deal with the duplicate-defeating epoch number mechanism from
// the midterm (chapter06) exercise. hints/hint00 provides the necessary
// changes to network.s.dfy file, if you are uncomfortable trying to make that
// change yourself.

// Here are some handy library functions that you may find useful for
// manipulating maps.
//
// You may recall that, in some lecture examples, we
// refined a hash table to a map, and then a sharded hash table to a map.
// Your protocol doesn't NOT need to build a linear-probing hash table --
// the local state on each Host may be a Dafny map<>.
